# Finding-a-Correlation-Between-Phone-Screen-Time-and-Previous-Grade-Point-Semester-GPS-_SSM

This project investigated the relationship between university students’ smartphone screen time and their academic performance (Grade Point Semester). The survey aimed to understand how screen habits, both quantity and type of usage, affect students’ learning focus and outcomes.

**Tools**: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, WordCloud, Scikit-learn

**Approach**: Conducted a student survey via Google Forms, followed by data preprocessing (cleaning nulls, correcting typos, and renaming columns) and exploratory text mining on open-ended responses. Descriptive statistics and correlation analysis (Spearman) were used to explore the link between screen time behavior and academic performance.

**Results**: Analysis revealed no strong correlation between total screen time and GPA. Most students spent over 8 hours daily on their smartphones regardless of GPA level. However, higher-GPA students balanced productivity and entertainment app use more effectively.

**Key Insight**: The type and purpose of smartphone use, not its duration, showed stronger links to academic success. Distraction management and app prioritization are more influential than simply limiting screen time.
